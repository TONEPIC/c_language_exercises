/* In this task you will continue working on the linked list of students in which you would like to store, for each student, their name and age. As before you are provided with some code that you should not modify:

    A structure definition for the storage of each student's information.
    A main() function to test your code. 
    Prototypes for the functions createStudent(), append(), printStudents (from previous tasks) and freeStudents() (from the current task).

You will need the function definitions (from previous tasks) for createStudent(), append(), printStudents() as well as any other functions you added, such as copyStr() for example. If you were unable to solve the previous task you have the option to be given the code for the printStudents() function (see the quiz preceding this task) so that you can work on the current task.

Your current task is to write a function freeStudents() which takes as input a pointer that holds the address of the start of a linked list of students. Your function should then free the space allocated for each student in this list of students. Your function should not return anything.

struct student *append(struct student * end, struct student * newStudptr);
void printStudents(struct student *start);
void freeStudents(struct student *start);
// add any other prototypes as needed
