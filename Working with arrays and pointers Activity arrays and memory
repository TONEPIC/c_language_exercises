/*You are designing a new cookie recipe and are experimenting with different amounts of wet (water, oil) and dry (flour, sugar, cocoa powder) ingredients in order to get the proportions just right. All of these amounts are initially read from the user input, and the code to do so, along with all variable declarations, had already been completed. You are interested in the total amount of wet and dry ingredients used in the recipe as well as the ratio of these two quantities.

Take a look at the code that is already given to you. Your job is to add four lines of code, precisely where indicated by a comment such as

//Add one line here

Beneath each such line you will find an explanation of what precisely your line of code is supposed to do as well as what type of array addressing you are to use. Please read and follow these directions carefully. Do not change anything else in the code that is provided as our grading system will detect such changes and mark your solution as incorrect.

       You believe that any cookie recipe should use equal amounts of water and oil.
       Without changing the total amount of wet ingredients, update the values for
       water and oil, using only the array cookie (and not the array wet) so that 
       these amounts will be equal. The easiest way to do so is to assign the value
       totalWet/2 to both the water and the oil entry. When addressing the array cookie,
       do not use any brackets at all this time.
